After merging if we again go to our branch and make changes in file. Then we have commit changes via 
$git commit -a -m "Content added to file 3"  #here -a ensure we don’t need to add the files again. We could only do this with already added file to index.

You can always check the file content by 
$cat filename.txt


Rebasing

Just do the indexing of branch changes in a linear way.

Lets say we added few more files in branch1
After adding and commit 
When we come back to master branch again just follow the below git command
$git rebase branch1 

Then running the ls command we will see all files on the master branch.
