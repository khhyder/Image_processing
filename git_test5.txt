Git Push

Now its time to give back all my works to the remote repository (GITHUB)


Step 1: generate ssh key
Ssh-keygen
Step 2. A .pub file will be generated 
Step3: $cat .pub file address will show the ssh key

To add that key on your github account:
	1. Go to your github account
	2. Click on settings then click on "SSH and GPG keys"
	3. Paste the generated key on that give a title and save

To authenticate the key that you just pasted (see its been gray marked)
Go to git command line
$ssh -T  git@github.com

Now its time to push 
Before pushing it is suggested that you will push your branch file so that other partners 
Could identify you works.

$git checkout branch1

$git push origin branch1
